                            <p>Dell is pleased to provide this Field Marketing Program (“Program”) to Dell PartnerDirect Partners in the United States. The purpose of this Program is to provide certain marketing development funds, as further described herein, (“Funds”) to Dell PartnerDirect Partners for Partners’ promotion of Dell products and services and to generate marketing leads for Dell products and services (each such promotional activity an “Activity”). Funds are provided on a first-come,
                                first-serve basis, and approval of Fund proposals is subject to the following criteria:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Partner must hold one or more active competencies within Enterprise (Storage, Server, and/or Networking) and
                                    maintain a Preferred or Premier Partner status</li><br>
                                <li>Submission of a clearly defined outline of the proposed marketing activity</li><br>
                                <li>Review of Partner’s frequency of previous promotional funding requests</li><br>
                                <li>Discussion with Partner’s designated field marketing manager of Partner’s customer end-user leads database prior
                                    to the proposed marketing activity</li><br>
                                <li>Verification of Partner’s relationship with local System Engineer (“SE”), Solutions Specialist (“SS”) and/or a Channel
                                    Account Manager (“CAM”)</li><br>
                                <li>Whether proposed marketing activity topic is appropriate to Partner’s location and region</li><br>
                                <li>Whether any overlap exists between the proposed marketing activity and another Partner’s approved marketing
                                    activity in the same location and region</li><br>
                                <li>Successfulness of prior Partner funded marketing activities</li><br>
                                <li>Whether marketing activity budget request is reasonable to type of activity requested</li><br>
                                <li>Any other requirement as deemed appropriate by Dell</li><br>
                            </ul>

                            <p>It is in Dell’s sole discretion to determine which Activities will be funded. In order to receive Funds, Partner must
                                submit a complete and accurate Dell Marketing/Demand Generation Request form via email to the Partner’s
                                pre-designated marketing manager forty-five (45) days prior to the target date of the Activity. Partners can determine
                                who their appropriate field marketing contact is by contacting the Partner Resource Desk at certified_PRD@dell.com), 
                                or by logging on to the Dell PartnerDirect Portal, going to the Demand Generation Center located under the Marketing 
                                and Sales Tab, and under the Q&A section, clicking on the “Who is my Dedicated Field Marketing Manager?” question. Partner 
                                will be notified via email within five to seven (5-7) business days of the submission date of Dell’s acceptance or rejection 
                                of the proposal as well as, if the proposal is accepted, a Dell MDF Program Confirmation of the Activity. All subsequent 
                                correspondence regarding this Activity must reference the MDF Approval Number found in the Dell MDF Program Confirmation. 
                                Activity requirements outlined in the Dell MDF Program Confirmation, as well as all requirements referenced herein must be 
                                met to qualify for the Funds.</p>

                            <p>Dell will fund up to fifty percent (50%) of the projected costs, based on actual costs incurred for an Activity. Funding will be proportionate to the number of Activity sponsors (i.e. - Dell and Partner: up to 50%; Dell, Channel Partner, and Technology Partner: up to 33%). If a Dell approved Activity is cancelled or postponed, the Partner must notify Dell in writing and every attempt must be made to provide cancellation notice at least fourteen (14) days prior to the Activity date.</p>
